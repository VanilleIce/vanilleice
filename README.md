## Hi, I'm VanilleIce üëã

### I've been creating wallpapers for you since 2021. I believe in passing on all my wallpapers and digital drawing knowledge so everyone can benefit!

### You can find a list of my most popular wallpapers on my project page or in my workshop.

### I ask you to support my work with a ‚ù§Ô∏è (heart) for the benefit of all. I currently spend about half my time creating wallpapers and the other half preparing them for

### Wallpaper Engine. My goal is for everyone to have a great background of mine.

### I don't earn any money with the work, so my works are under copyright and may not be sold or anything else done with them.
